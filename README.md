# Need not to speed
A top-view car game where you have to obey traffic law.

The game is not quite complete and I'm not sure about it's
destiny, maybe I will split it into modules to be able test
different AI driving approach, maybe I will leave it as is.
Anyway something works just now and it's able to run.
